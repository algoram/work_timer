# Work Timer

A simple Flutter application for Android phones that let's you track the time spent
on a project. I needed this to track how many hours I spent programming something.

NOTE: Currently I've only tested the app on my Android phone (running Android 11)
and on the emulator on my pc (running Android 8). I'm not planning on adding iOS
as of now. I might add support for the web and deploy the app somewhere like on
Firebase.

# To-Do
- [X] Make projects deletable
- [ ] Make cloud saving available
- [ ] Create team projects, where the owner can invite other people and track the total amount of time spent as well as each member's hours of work

# Android binaries
